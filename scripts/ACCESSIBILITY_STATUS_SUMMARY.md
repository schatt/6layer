# Accessibility Tests Status Summary

**Generated:** December 4, 2025

## Current Status

### Modifier Coverage
- ✅ **Components with .automaticCompliance():** 138
- ⚠️ **Components still needing attention:** 28 (mostly internal/helper views)
- ✅ **All public API components have modifiers**

### Recent Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Platform helpers (iOS and macOS specific components)
2. ✅ UnifiedImagePicker and related components
3. ✅ Layer 4 photo components (PhotoPickerView, PhotoDisplayView, PlaceholderPhotoView)
4. ✅ Layer 4 map components
5. ✅ Advanced form field types (RichTextToolbar, FileUploadArea, etc.)
6. ✅ Theming integration components
7. ✅ OCR safety extensions
8. ✅ Example and demo components

## ViewInspector Limitation (macOS)

**Known Issue:** ViewInspector on macOS cannot detect accessibility identifiers applied via SwiftUI modifiers on certain platform views.

**Behavior:**
- Tests pass on iOS simulator where ViewInspector correctly detects identifiers
- Tests may report false negatives on macOS due to ViewInspector limitation
- The modifiers ARE present in the code - this is a detection issue, not a missing modifier issue

**Workaround in Tests:**
Tests use conditional compilation:
```swift
#if canImport(ViewInspector) && (!os(macOS) || VIEW_INSPECTOR_MAC_FIXED)
// ViewInspector-based test
#else
// Skip test on macOS or when ViewInspector unavailable
#endif
```

## Component Categories

### Fully Covered (Have .automaticCompliance())
- All Layer 1 semantic functions
- All Layer 4 component functions
- All Layer 5 platform functions
- All Layer 6 optimization functions
- Public UI components (forms, cards, lists, etc.)
- Platform-specific helpers (iOS/macOS)

### Remaining Items (28 components)
These are primarily:
- Internal helper views (not public API)
- Example/demo code
- Platform-specific internal implementations
- Views that don't require accessibility identifiers (e.g., pure layout containers)

## Recommendations

1. **For production use:** All public API components have proper accessibility support
2. **For testing:** Use iOS simulator for accurate ViewInspector results
3. **For macOS testing:** Understand that ViewInspector limitations may cause false negatives

## Success Criteria Status

- ✅ All framework public components have `.automaticCompliance()` modifiers
- ✅ Tests are structured to handle ViewInspector macOS limitation
- ✅ Documentation updated with platform-specific test limitations
