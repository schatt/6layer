/// - macOS: Window-based navigation, sidebar navigation, menu routing
/// - visionOS: Spatial navigation, immersive routing, depth-based navigation

/// TODO: Implement platform-specific routing logic for green-phase testing
/// TODO: Update tests to verify actual routing behavior rather than just accessibility
