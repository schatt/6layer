/// - macOS: Image recognition, document analysis, pattern recognition
/// - visionOS: Spatial recognition, hand gesture recognition, immersive object detection

/// TODO: Implement platform-specific recognition logic for green-phase testing
/// TODO: Update tests to verify actual recognition functionality rather than just accessibility
