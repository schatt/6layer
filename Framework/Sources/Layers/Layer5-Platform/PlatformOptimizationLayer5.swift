/// Platform Optimization Layer 5 - UI Performance Optimization Across Platforms

/// This component handles UI performance optimization tailored to each platform's characteristics:
/// - iOS: Touch responsiveness, smooth animations, memory efficiency for mobile
/// - macOS: Window performance, large dataset handling, desktop-optimized rendering
/// - visionOS: Spatial rendering optimization, depth buffer management, immersive performance
///
/// TODO: Implement platform-specific UI optimization logic for green-phase testing
/// TODO: Update tests to verify actual performance optimizations rather than just accessibility
