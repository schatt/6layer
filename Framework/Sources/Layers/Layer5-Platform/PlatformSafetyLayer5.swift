/// - macOS: Keychain integration, file system permissions, security contexts
/// - visionOS: Spatial safety zones, hand tracking safety, immersive safety

/// TODO: Implement platform-specific safety logic for green-phase testing
/// TODO: Update tests to verify actual safety features rather than just accessibility
