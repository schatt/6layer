## Implementation

### License Compliance

The SixLayer Framework uses an **honor system** for license compliance. This means:

- **No technical enforcement** - the framework doesn't block features based on license
- **Trust-based** - we trust developers to comply with license terms
- **Self-reporting** - you determine your appropriate license tier
- **Community-focused** - built on mutual respect and fair use

### Determining Your License Tier

**Step 1: Count Your Users**
- Use your existing analytics (Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Count monthly active users (MAU) - unique users per month
- Include all users who interact with your app

**Step 2: Determine Your Tier**
- **Free**: Personal projects, open source, educational use
- **Startup**: < 1,000 MAU, any commercial use
- **Professional**: 1,000+ MAU with recurring revenue
- **Enterprise**: Internal commercial applications
- **Enterprise Plus**: High-volume applications (>20,000 MAU)

**Step 3: Purchase License (if needed)**
- Contact us for Professional, Enterprise, or Enterprise Plus licenses
- No license key required for Free or Startup tiers
- We'll provide billing and support information

### Using the Framework

```swift
import SixLayerFramework

// Use the framework normally - no license checks required
let manager = AccessibilityOptimizationManager()
manager.setAccessibilityLevel(.enhanced)

// All features are available - compliance is based on your license tier
platformPresentItemCollection_L1(
    items: vehicles,
    hints: PresentationHints(
        dataType: .collection,
        presentationPreference: .cards,
        complexity: .moderate,
        context: .dashboard
    )
)
```
