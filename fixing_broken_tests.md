fixing the test compilation means the following:

Fix Compilation Errors Only
Fix syntax errors that prevent Swift from compiling the tests
Fix type mismatches where arguments don't match function signatures
Fix missing imports or undefined symbols
Fix incorrect method calls or property access
Use production structs only. Do not mask them with local testing structs - that adds no value, and can mask errors.
What This Does NOT Mean
Remove or comment out tests for functionality that should exist
Skip testing features that are supposed to work
Delete test cases just because they're failing
Making any core data changes.
What This DOES Mean
Stub out missing functions in the framework to allow tests to compile
Fix incorrect assumptions in tests (wrong arguments, outdated expectations)
Update tests to match current API signatures
Add missing imports or dependencies
The Goal
Get to a "green phase" where all tests compile successfully, following TDD principles:
Red: Tests fail (compilation errors)
Green: Tests compile and pass (with stubbed implementations)
Refactor: Improve the implementation while keeping tests green

Things to note:
Tests might be wrong. Some tests might still exist when the code has been removed (and the test should be too!) Some tests are outdated (because it's been a while since the tests worked, some probably got overlooked and are testing outdated assumptions). 
Basically, the tests are not a sole source of correct truth. A combination of knowing our framework's goals, the actual code, and the existing tests should help us guide our path to fixing the tests.

Ensure tests will run but fail until stubs are filled with real code (proper TDD red phase)
