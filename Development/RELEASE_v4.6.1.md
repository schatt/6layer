# 🎨 Six-Layer Framework v4.6.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Version**: v4.6.1  
**Type**: Minor Enhancement  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 **Release Overview**

This release enhances the visual design of card components by adding conditional styling that distinguishes placeholder content from actual data. Empty fields now display in a lighter grey color, providing better visual clarity and improved user experience.

---

## 🆕 **What's New**

### **UI Placeholder Styling**
- Empty fields now display in lighter grey (`.secondary`) color
- Users can easily distinguish between placeholder text and actual content
- Enhanced user experience with clear visual indicators

### **Visual Clarity Improvements**
- Placeholder text (like 'Title') displays in `.secondary` color
- Actual content displays in `.primary` color
- Better visual hierarchy and content understanding

---

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **Card Component Enhancements**
- Added `isPlaceholderTitle` computed property to all card component structs:
  - `ExpandableCardComponent`
  - `CoverFlowCardComponent` 
  - `SimpleCardComponent`
  - `ListCardComponent`
  - `MasonryCardComponent`

### **Conditional Styling Implementation**
```swift
Text(cardTitle)
    .font(.headline)
    .lineLimit(2)
    .foregroundColor(isPlaceholderTitle ? .secondary : .primary)
```

### **Smart Detection Logic**
```swift
private var isPlaceholderTitle: Bool {
    CardDisplayHelper.extractTitle(from: item, hints: hints) == nil
}
```
