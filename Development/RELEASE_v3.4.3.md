# SixLayer Framework v3.4.3 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** 3.4.3  
**Type:** Critical Bug Fix - TextContentType Functionality Restored

## üö® Critical Bug Fix

This release fixes a critical bug in v3.4.2 where the text content type functionality was completely broken. While v3.4.2 claimed to be "stable and ready for production use," it had a major functional issue that rendered the cross-platform text content type feature non-functional.

## üêõ What Was Broken in v3.4.2

### The Problem
- **TextContentType variables were captured but never used**: Code used `if let textContentType = field.textContentType` but never applied the content type to TextFields
- **No semantic hints**: Text fields had no autofill suggestions, keyboard hints, or accessibility improvements
- **Cross-platform feature broken**: The entire text content type system was non-functional
- **Misleading release**: v3.4.2 claimed stability while having a major feature broken

### Impact
- Text fields behaved like basic text inputs with no semantic understanding
- No autofill suggestions for email, password, or other content types
- No keyboard optimizations based on field purpose
- Accessibility features were not working
- Cross-platform text content type feature was essentially disabled

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed in v3.4.3

### Core Fixes

- **PlatformSemanticLayer1.swift**: Now properly applies `textContentType.uiTextContentType` to TextFields
- **DynamicFormView.swift**: Now properly applies `textContentType.uiTextContentType` to TextFields
- **Conditional Compilation**: Added proper `#if canImport(UIKit)` guards for platform-specific functionality
- **TextContentType Application**: Text fields now receive semantic hints as intended

### Functionality Restored

- **Autofill Suggestions**: Text fields now provide appropriate autofill suggestions
- **Keyboard Optimization**: iOS keyboards show relevant suggestions based on content type
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies receive proper semantic information
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Same field definitions work identically across all platforms
- **Semantic Hints**: Text fields understand their purpose (email, password, name, etc.)

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified

**Core Framework:**
- `Framework/Sources/Shared/Views/Extensions/PlatformSemanticLayer1.swift`
- `Framework/Sources/Shared/Views/DynamicFormView.swift`

### Code Changes

**Before (Broken):**
```swift
if let textContentType = field.textContentType {
    TextField(field.placeholder ?? "Enter text", text: .constant(""))
        .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
    // textContentType was captured but never used!
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```swift
if let textContentType = field.textContentType {
    TextField(field.placeholder ?? "Enter text", text: .constant(""))
        .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        #if canImport(UIKit)
        .textContentType(textContentType.uiTextContentType)
        #endif
}
```

## üß™ Testing Results

### Build Verification
- ‚úÖ **Swift Build**: Successful compilation
- ‚úÖ **Test Execution**: 1586 tests executed successfully
- ‚úÖ **Platform Coverage**: iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Support**: arm64, x86_64

### Functionality Verification
