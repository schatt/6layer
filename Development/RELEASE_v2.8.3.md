# SixLayer Framework v2.8.3 Release Notes

**Release Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Type**: Bug Fix Release  
**Breaking Changes**: None  

## üéØ Overview

This release fixes critical compilation errors in the SixLayer Framework, ensuring the codebase builds successfully across all supported platforms. The fixes address Swift language compliance issues and improve type safety while maintaining full backward compatibility.

**Note**: This release corrects v2.8.2 which was incomplete and only contained documentation changes without the actual code fixes.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### **AccessibilityOptimizationManager.swift**
- **Issue**: `AccessibilitySystemChecker.SystemState` didn't conform to `Equatable`
- **Fix**: Added `Equatable` conformance to enable proper state comparison
- **Impact**: Resolves compilation error on line 84

### **IntelligentFormView.swift**
- **Issue**: Missing required parameters in method calls
- **Fix**: Updated all calls to `generateFormContent` and layout methods to include missing `dataBinder` and `formStateManager` parameters
- **Impact**: Resolves compilation errors on lines 38, 94, and 168

- **Issue**: `analyticsManager` and `inputHandlingManager` were not in scope
- **Fix**: Added these parameters to all relevant method signatures and propagated them through the call chain
- **Impact**: Resolves compilation errors on lines 405 and 415

- **Issue**: Methods using internal types must be declared internal
- **Fix**: Changed extension methods from `public` to `internal` visibility
- **Impact**: Resolves compilation errors on lines 704 and 729

- **Issue**: Incorrect argument order in `trackFieldInteraction` call
- **Fix**: Reordered parameters to match method signature (`userId` before `interactionType`)
- **Impact**: Resolves compilation error on line 468

### **PlatformSemanticLayer1.swift**
- **Issue**: Deprecated string interpolation with unsupported types
- **Fix**: Wrapped `type(of: content)` and `dictContent[key]` with `String(describing:)` to convert them to strings first
- **Impact**: Resolves deprecation warnings on lines 1069 and 1084

## üîß Technical Details

### **Type Safety Improvements**
- All method signatures now properly include required parameters
- Parameter order matches method definitions
- Internal types are properly scoped

### **Swift Language Compliance**
- Fixed deprecated string interpolation usage
