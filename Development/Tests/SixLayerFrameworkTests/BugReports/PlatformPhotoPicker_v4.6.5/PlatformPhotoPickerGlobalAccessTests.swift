//  Bug Report: SixLayerFramework 4.6.5 platformPhotoPicker_L4 global access bug
//  Created: January 27, 2025
//
//  TDD TEST: This test verifies that platformPhotoPicker_L4 is accessible as a global function
//  without requiring a PlatformPhotoComponentsLayer4 class instance. This test would have FAILED
//  between commit f819efa (when methods became instance methods) and v4.6.5 (when we fixed it).
