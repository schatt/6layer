//  PlatformImageBreakingChangeDetectionTests.swift
//  SixLayerFrameworkTests
//
//  BUSINESS PURPOSE:
//  Tests that would have FAILED with the PlatformImage breaking change in 4.6.2.
//  These tests prove our testing failure by demonstrating what we should have caught.
//
//  TESTING SCOPE:
//  - Tests that execute the exact broken code paths
//  - Tests that would have failed before our backward compatibility fix
//  - Tests that verify the actual delegate method execution
//  - Tests that prove our testing gap
//
//  METHODOLOGY:
//  - Execute the actual delegate methods that contain broken code
//  - Test the exact API patterns that were broken
//  - Verify that these tests would have caught the breaking change
//  - Demonstrate what proper testing should look like
//
//  CRITICAL: These tests MUST execute the actual broken code paths
