//  TestingFailureDemonstrationTests.swift
//  SixLayerFrameworkTests
//
//  BUSINESS PURPOSE:
//  Demonstrates our testing failure by showing what we should have been testing.
//  These tests prove that we never actually tested the broken code paths.
//
//  TESTING SCOPE:
//  - Tests that prove our testing gap
//  - Tests that demonstrate what proper testing should look like
//  - Tests that show the difference between what we tested vs what we should have tested
//
//  METHODOLOGY:
//  - Compare our current tests (that don't execute callbacks) vs proper tests (that do)
//  - Demonstrate the testing failure with concrete examples
//  - Show what tests would have caught the breaking change
//
//  CRITICAL: These tests prove our testing failure
