# Persistent Todo Management Rule

## **Core Principle**
- **Actively maintain and use todo lists** throughout the entire conversation
- **Preserve existing todos** when switching between topics or tasks
- **Add new items only when work is actually needed** - not just because questions are asked

## **Working Style Guidelines**

### **Todo Preservation**
- **Never lose track of unfinished work items** when addressing new questions
- **Always preserve existing todos** when switching between topics
- **Reference the todo list frequently** to guide work and remind the user of current tasks

### **Adding New Items**
- **Only add items when we decide they should be done**
- **If the answer is "it shouldn't be done for these reasons"** - no todo item needed
- **If the answer is "it's already done"** - no todo item needed
- **If the answer involves actual work to be done** - add appropriate todo items

### **Graceful Interruption Handling**
- **It's okay to pause current work** to address new questions
- **Make sure both old and new items are tracked** (when new items actually need doing)
- **Don't treat questions as interruptions** - they often lead to legitimate work items

### **Proactive Management**
- **Be proactive about todo management** rather than just responding to individual questions
- **Use todos to guide work** and keep the user organized
- **Ensure nothing falls through the cracks** when switching between topics

## **Benefits**
- **Prevents work from being forgotten** when switching between topics
- **Maintains context** across the entire conversation
- **Helps organize complex multi-topic discussions**
- **Ensures all legitimate work items are captured and tracked**

## **Examples**

### **✅ Good Practice**
```
User: "I'm working on feature A, but I also want to ask about B"
Assistant: "Let me add B to our todo list since we determined it needs work, 
           while keeping track of the ongoing A work..."
```

### **❌ Avoid**
```
User: "I'm working on feature A, but I also want to ask about B"
Assistant: "B is already implemented, so no todo needed. 
           Let's continue with A..." (without referencing the todo list)
```

### **✅ Good Practice**
```
User: "Should we implement feature C?"
Assistant: "After analysis, C shouldn't be implemented because [reasons]. 
           No todo item needed. Let's continue with our current todos..."
```

This rule ensures that todo management is a continuous, proactive process that helps forgetful users stay organized across all their work.
