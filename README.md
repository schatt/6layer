## 🚀 Getting Started

### **For Users (Consuming the Framework):**
Navigate to the `Framework/` directory and use it as a Swift Package:

```swift
// In your Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/schatt/6layer.git", from: "4.1.1")
]
```

### **For Developers (Contributing):**
- **Framework Code**: `Framework/Sources/`
- **Documentation**: `Framework/docs/`
- **Project Status**: `Development/todo.md`
- **Tests**: `Development/Tests/`

## 📦 Swift Package

The framework is distributed as a Swift Package from the `Framework/` directory. This ensures that only the essential framework code is included when other projects consume it.

## 🆕 Latest Release: v4.1.1

### **Critical Bug Fix Release**
🚨 **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed automatic accessibility identifier generation that was broken in v4.1.0. The Enhanced Breadcrumb System now works correctly, generating proper accessibility identifiers for UI testing.

**Highlights:**
- ✅ **Working Automatic Accessibility Identifiers** - Fixed critical bug from v4.1.0
- ✅ **Enhanced Breadcrumb System** - View hierarchy tracking, screen context awareness
- ✅ **UI Test Code Generation** - Creates XCTest code from breadcrumb data
- ✅ **File Generation** - Saves test code to `~/Documents/autoGeneratedTests/`
- ✅ **Clipboard Integration** - Copy test code for easy pasting
- ✅ **Enhanced Debug Output** - Rich debugging with hierarchy and context
- ✅ **UI Test Helpers** - Generate tap actions, text input actions
- ✅ **1654 Comprehensive Tests** - All tests pass (0 failures)
- ✅ **5 New TDD Tests** - Validates the bug fix
- ✅ **Proper TDD Process** - Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed

**Example:**
```swift
platformPresentItemCollection_L1(
    items: products,
    hints: hints,
    customItemView: { product in
        MyCustomProductView(product: product)
    }
)
```
