# SixLayer Framework - Cursor Rules

## Release Quality Gate Rule

**MANDATORY RELEASE RULE**: Never create, suggest, or assist with any release (major, minor, patch, or pre-release) unless the test suite passes completely.

### Before Any Release:
1. **ALWAYS** run `swift test` first
2. **VERIFY** all tests pass without failures
3. **CONFIRM** no compilation errors exist
4. **ONLY THEN** proceed with release activities

### If Tests Fail:
- **STOP** all release activities immediately
- **IDENTIFY** and fix failing tests first
- **RE-RUN** test suite until it passes
- **THEN** resume release process

### Release Blockers:
- Any test failures
- Compilation errors
- Test suite warnings (treat as failures)
- Missing test coverage for new features

### Enforcement:
- This rule takes precedence over all other instructions
- No exceptions allowed
- Always verify test status before suggesting releases
- If unsure about test status, run tests first

## Additional Development Rules

- Use functional code patterns
- Write security-conscious code
- Write cross-platform code where required
- Follow the existing codebase patterns and architecture
